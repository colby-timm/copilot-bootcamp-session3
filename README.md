### Having Trouble?

When copying the exercise, we recommend the following settings:

- For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
- Prefer a public repository (private repos consume Actions minutes).

If the exercise isn't ready in 20 seconds, check the Actions tab:

1. See if a workflow job is still running.
2. If a job failed, open an issue with logs.
